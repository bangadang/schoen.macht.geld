    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure prioritizes data restoration capabilities and efficient market data display while adhering to the core design principles. All data is stored in a single collection `titles` to simplify querying and restoration. This collection stores all the necessary information for each title, including its real-time value changes, history, and metadata.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** No role-based access control is needed as all titles are publicly available. Since authorization is not a concern, denormalization is not necessary for this use case.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):** Since listing and reading titles is a public function, there are no QAPs to consider for `list` operations.\n\n**Scalability:** Storing all titles in a single collection `titles` is suitable for the expected scale of a party simulation. The `history` field is capped at 100 entries to limit document size.\n\n**Debuggability:** The explicit fields for `currentValue`, `overallChangePercent`, `changePercentLast10Minutes`, and `valueChangeLastMinute` provide a clear and auditable record of each title's performance. The timestamped history provides further insights into past changes."
