## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A020F0) for a sense of power and luxury.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E0F7), a very desaturated version of the primary purple.
- Accent color: Blue (#20A0F0), an analogous color to the primary purple.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif font for a precise, contemporary feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a set of financial and playful icons to illustrate stock data and company profiles.
- Kiosk layouts for the second app, making the screen easy to navigate without instruction or explanation.
- Use subtle animations when the tinderesque element gets swiped. Use attention-grabbing animations when AI generates hilarious texts.
